# Store Cart



In this challenge i'm building a store cart to calculate totals and manage quantities.


# Run the App

- Inside the folder run ```npm install```

- Run ```npm run start```, when building is finished the app should be available by http://localhost:1234



# Stack used



- NPM

- React

- React-Router

- Redux



# Features



- Increment/Decrease quantities of a product in cart;

- Calculate Totals;

- Remove Items from cart;

- Show error in quantities;
- Validate Stock levels;
- Responsive design in table;



## Others

Unfortunately with the current stack used i wasn't able to run tests. I developed a test for CartController.js, but doe to errors in modules needed to run jest with Parcel configuration, which i wasn't able to overcome, the jest run fails.

## Improvments

- API calls for a list of Products;
- Resolve Jest issues;
